## Background
Multi-armed bandit (MAB) optimization is a reinforcement learning approach that combines exploration and exploitation within a sequential experiment. In traditional experimental setups, researchers *explore* by testing all alternatives equally and evaluate outcomes only after the experiment has ended. In contrast, MAB optimization continuously learns from the data that arrives during the experiment and immediately *exploits* this information to improve allocation decisions. This means that MAB experiments not only generate knowledge but also earn on that knowledge *while still running*.
